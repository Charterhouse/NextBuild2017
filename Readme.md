The Power of Blockchain
=======================
*Session Proposal for NextBuild 2017*

To really show you the power of Blockchain we are going to demonstrate how you can easily make an application that can be trusted by anyone. We will create a game where *cheating is impossible*. The game is a live guessing game. Anyone can set a challenge consisting of a question, its answer, and prize money [1]. The first person to give the correct answer wins that challenge, and takes away the prize money.

The game consists of a web based UI, and a smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain where you would normally find the backend. This smart contract ensures that *not even us* can cheat the game.

We won’t bore you with powerpoint bullet lists from hell, nor will we simply use handwaving to explain the concepts. We will go on stage and *actually* program the game during this session. We’ll show you that ~~even~~ especially in immature development environments you can rely on good coding practices such as Test Driven Development and Continuous Integration.

We intend for you to walk away from this session not only knowing how to start developing a Blockchain app, but also wanting to!

[1] The money is in fact just a number of crypto-tokens, which can represent any physical good(ie)s. So if you're lucky we may actually provide some of those goodies...
